## 🚀 Featured Projects

### 🔹 Algo-bot Trading Assistant  
A Flask + WebSocket-based algorithmic trading system integrating Alpaca API for live portfolio execution and monitoring.  
**Features:** real-time signal processing, RSI/MACD-based triggers, statistical arbitrage models.

### 🔹 Quantum & Hybrid Portfolio Optimization  
Applied **Qiskit**, **VQE**, and **QAOA** to optimize risk-adjusted returns across an 8-year, 52-asset dataset.  
Benchmarked quantum-inspired algorithms vs. classical optimizers (GEKKO, Kelly, Markowitz).

### 🔹 CryoET Object Identification  
Trained **PyTorch** CNN models for 3D protein structure detection in cryo-electron tomography images, improving recall on high-dimensional biomedical data.

### 🔹 The Cost of Democracy  
Built a Python **NLP + time-series** pipeline combining SerpAPI, FRED, and Hugging Face models to study links between consumer costs and macroeconomic factors.
