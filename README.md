## Featured Projects

### 🔹 AlphaGoat 
GAN-driven market simulator + reinforcement-learning trader. Generates realistic 1-minute stock data with a conditional **Wasserstein GAN** and trains a DQN agent to trade long/flat/short on live Alpaca feeds, complete with rich technical-indicator conditioning and buy/sell visualizations.

### 🔹 algo-bot 
A **Flask + WebSocket**-based algorithmic trading system integrating Alpaca API for live portfolio execution and monitoring.  
**Features:** real-time signal processing, RSI/MACD-based triggers, statistical arbitrage models.

### 🔹  deepstock 
A deep learning framework for stock price prediction and forecasting with **LSTMs**, featuring evaluation metrics, residual analysis, volatility indicators, and visualization tools.

### 🔹 CryoET Object Identification  
Trained **PyTorch** CNN models for 3D protein structure detection in cryo-electron tomography images, improving recall on high-dimensional biomedical data.

### 🔹 The Cost of Democracy  
Built a Python **NLP + time-series** pipeline combining SerpAPI, FRED, and Hugging Face models to study links between consumer costs and macroeconomic factors.
